# Multistep Form

The Multistep Form project is a comprehensive open-source project built with ReactJS and SASS, utilizing the Vite framework for rapid development. This project aims to simplify the process of creating multistep forms in web applications, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience for form submissions.

The Multistep Form project leverages the power and flexibility of ReactJS to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. By breaking down complex forms into smaller, manageable steps, users can easily navigate through the form sections, providing information at their own pace. ReactJS's state management capabilities ensure smooth transitions between steps and efficient data persistence.

With the inclusion of SASS, the Multistep Form project offers extensive styling possibilities. The use of SASS allows for modular and reusable styling components, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design throughout the form. Customizable themes, colors, and styles enable developers to tailor the form's appearance to suit their specific project requirements.

Built upon the Vite framework, the Multistep Form project benefits from its optimized development workflow. Vite's fast development and compilation times expedite the development process, enabling quick iterations and efficient code execution. Bundling and optimization techniques provided by Vite contribute to a performant and responsive form application.
